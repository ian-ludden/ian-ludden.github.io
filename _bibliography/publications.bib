  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic hastened hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States. Many of these excess deaths are directly attributed to COVID-19, but others stem from the pandemic’s social, economic, and health care system disruptions. This study compares provisional mortality data for age and sex subgroups across different time windows, with and without COVID-19 deaths, and assesses whether mortality risks are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Using provisional mortality reports from the CDC, we compute mortality risks for 22 age and sex subgroups in 2021 and compare against 2015–2019 using odds ratios. We repeat this comparison for the first twelve full months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (April 2020–March 2021) against the next twelve full months (April 2021–March 2022). Mortality risks for most subgroups were significantly higher in 2021 than in 2015–2019, both with and without deaths involving COVID-19. For ages 25–54, Year 2 (April 2021–March 2022) was more fatal than Year 1 (April 2020–March 2021), whereas total mortality risks for the 65+ age groups declined. Given so many displaced (i.e., earlier than expected) deaths in the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality risks in the next few years may fall below pre-pandemic levels. Provisional mortality data suggest this is already happening for the 75+ age groups when excluding COVID-19 deaths.},

abstract = {Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between passengers on airplanes is a significant concern and reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses aboard aircraft could save lives. Solving the Airplane Seating Assignment Problem (ASAP) produces seating arrangements that minimize transmission risks between passengers aboard an aircraft, but the chosen risk model affects the optimal seating arrangement. We analyze previous risk models and introduce two new risk models, masked and unmasked, based on previous experiments performed aboard real aircraft to test aerosol dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 sized particles. We make recommendations on when each risk model is applicable and the types of seating arrangements that are optimal for each risk model.},

abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 
began infecting humans in late 2019 and has since spread to over 57 million people and caused over 1.75 million deaths, 
as of December 27, 2020. In response to reduced demand and travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, 
airlines experienced a 94% reduction in passenger capacity worldwide in April and an estimated 60% reduction 
in passengers transported for all of 2020. 
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to spread on airplanes by infected passengers, 
so minimizing the risk of secondary infections aboard aircraft may save lives. 
We present the airplane seating assignment problem (ASAP) to minimize transmission risks on airplanes, 
and we provide two models to solve ASAP. 
We show that both models can be effectively solved using a standard commercial solver and that seating assignments 
provided by these models have lower aggregate risk than the strategy of blocking the middle seats, 
given the same number of passengers. The available risk models for aircraft are based on influenza data, 
and hence risk models based on SARS-CoV-2 should be developed to maximize the benefits of our research.},

abstract = {Each year, the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament attracts popular attention, including bracket challenges where fans seek to pick the winners of the tournament's games. However, the quantity and unpredictable nature of games suggest a single bracket will likely select some winning teams incorrectly even if created with insightful and sophisticated methods. Hence, rather than focusing on creating a single bracket to perform well, a challenge participant may wish to create a pool of brackets that likely contains at least one high-scoring bracket. This paper proposes a power model to estimate tournament outcome probabilities based on past tournament data. Bracket pools are generated for the 2013–2019 tournaments using six generators, five using the power model and one using the Bradley-Terry model. The generated brackets are assessed by the ESPN scoring system and compared to those produced by a traditional pick favorite approach as well as the highest scoring brackets in the ESPN Tournament Challenge for each year.},
