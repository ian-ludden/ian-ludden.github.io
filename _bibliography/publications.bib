  abstract = {The Spherical Zoning Problem (SZP) seeks to partition a finite 3D volume comprised of convex polytope cells, or units, into k zones such that each zone’s surface is spherical (i.e., homeomorphic to a sphere). A special case of the classical Connected Graph Partition Problem, SZP is motivated by applications in 3D geospatial partitioning such as airspace sectorization and oceanographic clustering. For general graph partitioning problems, local search optimization often considers the flip operation, which transfers one cell from its current zone, or part, to a neighboring zone in each iteration. Applying local search optimization to SZP requires new computational methods to assess flip feasibility; methods tailored to planar graph partitioning (e.g., for geographic districting) break down when faced with the spherical zones constraint due to inherent complexities when extending from 2D to 3D environments. This paper introduces the 3D geo-graph, a model for enforcing zone sphericity during a local search flip for solving SZP. The time complexity of SZP flip verification with the 3D geo-graph is, in the worst case, linear in the number of cells sharing some boundary with the flipped cell and linearithmic in the number of faces, edges, and vertices on the cell’s surface. Computational experiments on space-filling honeycombs demonstrate that the 3D geo-graph enables efficient flip verification for large-scale SZP instances.},

  abstract = {Political redistricting in the United States is the process of drawing congressional and state legislative district boundaries. This work introduces the bisection protocol, a two-player, zero-sum, extensive-form game motivated by political redistricting in which two players alternately divide pieces of a region in half (up to rounding) to obtain a district plan. A subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is presented for the protocol in a relaxed continuous nongeometric setting, and a recurrence is given for the optimal strategies. The bisection protocol is compared with the recently proposed I-cut-you-freeze protocol across a variety of standard fairness metrics. A hardness result is presented for the bisection protocol in the more realistic discrete geometric setting along with exact equilibrium strategies for small grid graphs. Because equilibrium computation is intractable for practical instances, heuristics are developed for both protocols that model players' drawing strategies as mixed-integer linear programs. When the heuristics are applied to congressional redistricting in Iowa with counties preserved, both protocols produce district plans that are fairer (according to three popular metrics) than Iowa's 115th congressional districts. Finally, the bisection heuristic is used to generate congressional district plans from census tracts for 18 states, demonstrating its potential for practical use.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic hastened hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States. Many of these excess deaths are directly attributed to COVID-19, but others stem from the pandemic's social, economic, and health care system disruptions. This study compares provisional mortality data for age and sex subgroups across different time windows, with and without COVID-19 deaths, and assesses whether mortality risks are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Using provisional mortality reports from the CDC, we compute mortality risks for 22 age and sex subgroups in 2021 and compare against 2015-2019 using odds ratios. We repeat this comparison for the first twelve full months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (April 2020-March 2021) against the next twelve full months (April 2021-March 2022). Mortality risks for most subgroups were significantly higher in 2021 than in 2015-2019, both with and without deaths involving COVID-19. For ages 25-54, Year 2 (April 2021-March 2022) was more fatal than Year 1 (April 2020-March 2021), whereas total mortality risks for the 65+ age groups declined. Given so many displaced (i.e., earlier than expected) deaths in the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality risks in the next few years may fall below pre-pandemic levels. Provisional mortality data suggest this is already happening for the 75+ age groups when excluding COVID-19 deaths.},

abstract = {Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between passengers on airplanes is a significant concern and reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses aboard aircraft could save lives. Solving the Airplane Seating Assignment Problem (ASAP) produces seating arrangements that minimize transmission risks between passengers aboard an aircraft, but the chosen risk model affects the optimal seating arrangement. We analyze previous risk models and introduce two new risk models, masked and unmasked, based on previous experiments performed aboard real aircraft to test aerosol dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 sized particles. We make recommendations on when each risk model is applicable and the types of seating arrangements that are optimal for each risk model.},

abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 
began infecting humans in late 2019 and has since spread to over 57 million people and caused over 1.75 million deaths, 
as of December 27, 2020. In response to reduced demand and travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, 
airlines experienced a 94% reduction in passenger capacity worldwide in April and an estimated 60% reduction 
in passengers transported for all of 2020. 
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to spread on airplanes by infected passengers, 
so minimizing the risk of secondary infections aboard aircraft may save lives. 
We present the airplane seating assignment problem (ASAP) to minimize transmission risks on airplanes, 
and we provide two models to solve ASAP. 
We show that both models can be effectively solved using a standard commercial solver and that seating assignments 
provided by these models have lower aggregate risk than the strategy of blocking the middle seats, 
given the same number of passengers. The available risk models for aircraft are based on influenza data, 
and hence risk models based on SARS-CoV-2 should be developed to maximize the benefits of our research.},

abstract = {Each year, the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament attracts popular attention, including bracket challenges where fans seek to pick the winners of the tournament's games. However, the quantity and unpredictable nature of games suggest a single bracket will likely select some winning teams incorrectly even if created with insightful and sophisticated methods. Hence, rather than focusing on creating a single bracket to perform well, a challenge participant may wish to create a pool of brackets that likely contains at least one high-scoring bracket. This paper proposes a power model to estimate tournament outcome probabilities based on past tournament data. Bracket pools are generated for the 2013–2019 tournaments using six generators, five using the power model and one using the Bradley-Terry model. The generated brackets are assessed by the ESPN scoring system and compared to those produced by a traditional pick favorite approach as well as the highest scoring brackets in the ESPN Tournament Challenge for each year.},
