  <h2 id="notes">On Taking, Organizing, and Reviewing Notes</h2>
  <p>If you ask each of ten people to recommend a note-taking method, 
    you'll get twenty different answers. 
    Taking notes is an intrinsically personal task, and 
    you will inevitably change the way you take notes over time and 
    in different circumstances. That being said, 
    it's worth taking a look at popular systems and 
    borrowing features that work well for you.</p>

  <h3>Note-Taking Methods Worth Trying</h3>
  Here are some popular methods. Feel free to search online for others and see what you like. 
  <ul class="advice-list">
    <li><a href="https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 term" role="button">The Cornell Method</a>: A simple structure for jotting down key information, then organizing and summarizing it to build the bigger picture</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/blog/outline-note-taking-method" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 term" role="button">The Outline Method</a>: Probably your default, and works well if you have a good sense of the structure of what you're hearing/reading</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Paper, or Digital?</h3>
  <p>Some research (e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614524581" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 term" role="button">Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014</a>) suggests that taking longhand (paper) notes is better for learning than typing notes on a laptop. If you choose to type your notes, make sure you avoid using the extra speed to transcribe information verbatim, since much of the learning benefit of note-taking comes from your cognitive effort to paraphrase, condense, and summarize.</p>

  <h3>Digital Note Organization Systems</h3>
  <p>If you choose to organize your notes digitally, consider using a tool that makes it easy to link different notes to each other, such as <a href="https://obsidian.md/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 term" role="button">Obsidian</a>. (There are several similar systems, but I like Obsidian because it stores everything locally using simple Markdown files, as opposed to cloud-based tools with proprietary data formats.) For details on how you might use Obsidian to support your studying, including a quick-and-easy way to create and review flashcards, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAPn6yqrDxQ" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 term" role="button">this video tutorial</a>.</p> 

  <h3>Studying Old Notes</h3>
  <p>Re-reading your notes is one of the <em>least</em> effective ways to study, but it can be tempting because it takes little effort and gives you a sense of familiarity with the material. Instead, try creating and reviewing flashcards, working through practice problems (<em>interleaving</em> different types of problems, rather than doing all of one type before moving onto the next), and <em>spacing</em> your studying of a topic so you have started to forget by the time you go to review. For more study tips, read the book <a href="https://www.retrievalpractice.org/make-it-stick" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 term" role="button"><em>Make it Stick</em></a> and/or see these <a href="https://www.retrievalpractice.org/library" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 term" role="button">related resources</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="time-mgmt">On Time Management</h2>
  <p>In my experience, one of the biggest challenges students face when adapting to college is the reduced (and often variable) daily structure compared to high school. Short gaps between classes present golden opportunities to get started on a new assignment, review and organize notes from previous class sessions, or drop by an instructor's office hours for help. Save these &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Golden Gaps&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; from the clutches of doomscrolling, Discord, and other distractions by giving each one a purpose in advance. You can use a fancy term like <a href="https://asana.com/resources/what-is-timeboxing" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0 term" role="button">timeboxing</a> if you like, but the key idea is to pre-commit gaps of time in your schedule to specific tasks. You might schedule these a week in advance, or just the night before. And as your responsibilities ebb and flow throughout a term, you will probably find that you need to adjust how you're using your Golden Gaps, so don't hold too tightly to your initial plan.</p>
